# Simple-Linear-Regression
This repository includes a Python script implementing Simple Linear Regression using scikit-learn. It demonstrates data loading, visualization, model training, and evaluation. The script uses a dataset with hours studied and scores gained to build a regression model, predict outcomes, and calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
