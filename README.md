# Simple Linear Regression Model

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Simple Linear Regression model using Python and the scikit-learn library. The goal is to predict scores based on hours studied using a linear regression model.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Loads dataset from a provided URL.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes the relationship between hours studied and scores gained.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Simple Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
- **Prediction**: Predicts scores for test data.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

## Results

The script outputs the following:

- The coefficients and intercept of the linear regression model.
- A plot showing the regression line and data points.
- A table comparing actual and predicted scores for the test data.
- The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the model.
